= README: About this repository

This repository provides an installer of `commandunit` tool.
Also, this contains an example project to illustrate how to use `commanduunit` (https://github.com/dakusui/commandunit[github]) and how to organize a shell script based project using it.

To install it, just run:

[source, bash]
----
./install.sh
----

For more detail of installation, check <<installation>> section.

To just run tests under `src/main/scripts`, type the following command from your terminal:

[source, bash]
----
commandunit --clean <1>
----
<1> `commandunit` generates intermediate files and this is sometimes time-consuming if you have a lot of tests.
You can reuse already generated files by default. `--clean` cleans up them.

Note that you need a docker CLI installed, and docker daemon running.
Also, we tested this repository with `bash 5.1` (Ubuntu 22.04).

On a "successful" execution, it will show:

----

----

One and only one test in the example test suite should fail and the command should exit with `1`.
Don't worry, the one (`core/test-cat-failing.json`) is designed to fail intentionally in order to illustrate how a test report looks like.

[[installation]]
== Installation of `commandunit`

To try the from your command line, do:

----
./install.sh
----

This will download a "wrapper" script and place it under your `$HOME/bin` directory.
You need to have the directory in your `PATH` environment variable.


== Usage

=== Command Line

`commandunit` has "native" and normal (docker) execution modes.
The "native" mode uses command line tools installed on your system to execute `commandunit` 's functionality, while normal mode uses a docker image which contains all the necessary dependencies.
The default is the "normal" mode.
To use "native" mode, give `--native` option to `commandunit`.

."native" mode
----
commandunit --native
----

To show the help, use `--help` option.

.Help
----
commandunit --help
----

Also, check https://dakusui.github.io/commandunit/handbookCommandLine.html[Command Line Interface Handbook] for more detail.


=== Test Script Format

Following is an example of a test script defined for `commandunit`.
You can find a file in `src/test/scripts/core` directory.

[source,yaml]
.Example: `scripts/core/test-cat-yaml.yaml++`
----
---
"$extends":
  - core/base-yaml.yaml <1>
when: <2>
  environmentVariables:
    SCRIPTS_DIR: "${COMMANDUNIT_PROJECT_DIR}/src/main/scripts"
  source:
    - ${COMMANDUNIT_BUILTIN_ROOT}/bud/lib/core.rc
    - ${SCRIPTS_DIR}/target_lib.rc
  cmd: cat
  args:
    - ${SCRIPTS_DIR}/hello.txt
then:
  exitCode:
    - EQUAL
    - 0
  stdout:
    present:
      - REGEX:Hello world
  stderr:
    absent:
      - REGEX:.+
----
<1> Check <<extends_attribute>>
<2> Check <<when_clause>>

[[extends_attribute]]
==== `$extends` attribute
This attribute specifies a list of  yaml{plus}{plus}, json++, or json files that this file inherits.
In this example, it is specified that a file `core/base-yaml.yaml`.
The file is stored as `src/test/.commandunit/jsonpp/core/base-yaml.yaml`.
The file then extends `base/normal.json`, which is a built-in file, in the ends.
When you use `$extends` attribute, the file in the array will be searched from `src/test/.commandunit` and built-in directory.
The built-in templates available are found in the `commandunit` 's repository (https://github.com/dakusui/commandunit/tree/main/src/main/scripts/lib/jsonpp/base[built-in templates]).

[[when_clause]]
==== `when` clause

This attribute defines what will be exercised in a test.

`description`:: An array.
You can describe the operation to be verified in this test.
This attribute is currently a placce-holder and not used by the `commandunit`.
It may be a part of `testreport.adoc` in future, though.

====
[source,yaml]
----
  description:
    - Call 'abort' function define in core.rc.
    - This test is to illustrate the usage of the function.
----
====

`environmentVariables`:: An object.
You can store key-value pair whose key is a name of an environment variable.
The following example defines an environment variable `SCRITPS_DIR` and it will be available from the command defined by `cmd` and `args`.

====
[source,yaml]
----
  environmentVariables:
    SCRIPTS_DIR: "${COMMANDUNIT_HOSTFSROOT_MOUNTPOINT}/${COMMANDUNIT_PWD}/src/main/scripts"
----
====

`source`:: An array you can list files to be sourced before the command (`cmd`) is executed.

====
[source,yaml]
----
  source:
    - ${COMMANDUNIT_DEPENDENCIES_ROOT}/bud/lib/core.rc
    - ${COMMANDUNIT_HOSTFSROOT_MOUNTPOINT}/${COMMANDUNIT_PWD}/src/main/scripts/target_lib.rc
----
====

`cmd`(a string) and `args`(an array of strings)::
A command (or more generally an "executable", such as a function) to be executed and arguments to be passed to the command.
The following example executes a function, which is defined in `bud/core.rc`.
this example will execute a command line: `assert_that HELLO {startsb}{startsb} hello == Hello {endsb}{endsb}`

.`cmd` and `args` example

====
[source,yaml]
----
  cmd: assert_that
  args:
    - HELLO
    - "[["
    - hello
    - ==
    - Hello
    - "]]"
----
====

==== `then` clause

This attribute defines how the exercised operation is verified.

`description`:: You can describe how the operation defined in `when` should be verified.
`exitCode`:: An array.
You can describe the condition that should be satisfied by an exit code of `cmd` in `when` clause.
The first element is a name of a predicate factory and the rest will be arguments passed to the factory.
The exit code will then be checked with the predicated created by the factory.
Currently available predicate factory names are following:
- `EQUAL`
- `NOT_EQUAL`

====
[source,yaml]
----
  exitCode:
    - NOT_EQUAL
    - 0
----
====

`stdout` and `stderr`:: An object.
You can describe the expectation for `stdout` and `stderr` of `cmd` in `when` clause.
Under this object you can place `present` and `absent` attributes.
`present` and `absent`:: arrays.
These attributes define patterns that should present or absent in the target stream (`stdout` or `stderr`).
If you give a string starting with `REGEX:`, the rest will be treated as a regular expression.
If a matching line for a pattern in `present` attribute is find in the target stream, the condition defined by the string will be considered satisfied.
If and only if all the conditions defined for `present` are satisfied, the target stream will be considered "pass" for `present`.
For `absent`, if and only if none of the conditions defined for it are satisfied, the tatarget stream will be considered "pass".
Following is an example, where nothing should be output to `stdout`.
====
[source,yaml]
----
  stdout:
    absent:
      - REGEX:.+
----
====

==== Requirements for "native" mode

The `commandunit` can be used without using Docker.

- `tap`::

==== Environment Variables

Following is the list of built-in environment variables of `commandunit`.

`COMMANDUNIT_DEPENDENCIES_ROOT`::
A directory which stores built-in dependencies of `commandunit`.
(example: `/app/dependencies`).
`COMMANDUNIT_DIR`::
A directory which stores the project configuration.
(example: `/var/lib/commandunit/Users/hiroshi.ukai/Documents/github/commandunit-example/src/test/.commandunit`).
`COMMANDUNIT_HOME`:: (internal)A home directory of the `commandunit`.
(example: `/app`).
`COMMANDUNIT_HOSTFSROOT_MOUNTPOINT`::
A directory at which host side's root directory.
(example: `/var/lib/commandunit`).
`COMMANDUNIT_INDOCKER`:: An environment to check if this `commandunit` is executed as a docker container or not.
(example: `true`).
`COMMANDUNIT_LOGLEVEL`:: An environment variable to control the loglevel.
Valid values are `ERROR`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG`.
(example: `ERROR`).
`COMMANDUNIT_PWD`::
A project base directory in the host side's representation, not inside the docker container.
(example: `/Users/hiroshi.ukai/Documents/github/commandunit-example`).

==== Built-in Library

The `commandunit` has a set of libraries to make it easy to write tests.
The source of them can be found here: https://github.com/dakusui/commandunit/tree/main/src/main/scripts/dependencies/bud/lib[Built-in Libraries]

In this section, useful functions for testing will be walked through.

===== bud/core.rc

`message`:: prints a message to `stderr`.
`assert_that`:: tests a given condition (arguments except the first) and aborts if the condition doesn't hold.
The first argument will be contained in a message it prints.
`abort`:: aborts the execution. i.e., exits the test's execution with non-zero exit value.
A stack trace will be printed to `stderr`.

===== bud/logging.rc

`debug`:: prints a message to `stderr` as a `DEBUG` level log message.
`info`:: prints a message to `stderr` as a `INFO` level log message.
`error`:: prints a message to `stderr` as a `ERROR` level log message.

===== bud/json.rc

`to_json_array`:: prints a JSON array composed of given arguments.
`json_value_at`:: prints a JSON node specified by a path (second argument) in a given JSON node (first argument) `json_has_key`:: checks if an object node specified by a given path (third argument, default: `.`, which is root) in a given object node (first arguement) has a specified key (second argument).
`true` will be printed, if it has.
`false`, if not.
`json_type_of`::
prints a type (`object`, `array`, `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and `null`) of a given JSON node (first argument).
An error will be reported if it is not a malformed JSON string.
`json_object_merge`:: merges two object nodes into one.
If the same key appears, the second overrides the first.
`json_array_append`:: prints a JSON array by appending an array (second argument) to the other (first argument).

== Default Directory Layout

By default, `commandunit` assumes the compatible directory structure with `maven` based project <<maven>>.

[source]
.Default Directory Layout
----
src/
  main/
  test/                                 <1>
    .commandunit/                       <2>
      jsonpp/
    scripts/
target/
  commandunit/
    report/                             <3>
    work/                               <4>
      scripts/
        core/
          {testcase-1}.json
          {testcase-1}.json++
          {testcase-1}.yaml++
----

<1> A directory to store test scripts. (test script directory)
<2> A directory to store `commandunit` 's configuration. (test project configuration directory)
<3> A directory to which `commandunit` writes report.
(report directory)
<4> A directory to which `commandunit` stores processed test scripts.
(work directory)

You can change the directory layout through `commandunit` 's options.
Check the link:https://dakusui.github.io/commandunit/[documentation.]

=== Test Script Directory and Test Project Configuration Directory

By default, `./src/test` is considered a directory that stores your test scripts.
You can specify it by `--test-srcdir` option of the `commandunit`.

-----
src/
  test/
    .commandunit/
      jsonpp/
    scripts/
-----

Right under the test script directory, you can place a test project configuration directory.

=== Files in Report Directory

Following is the content of "report directory" after `commandunit` execution.
You can specify a report directory by `--test-reportdir` option of commandunit and its default is `target/commandunit/report`.

[source]
.Report Directory
----
target/
  commandunit/
    report/
      {testsuite-directory-name}/
        {testsuite-directory}/{testcase-1}.json-output/
        {testsuite-directory}/{testcase-2}.json-output/
      testreport.json
      testreport.adoc
----

For each of the `{test-case-#}` directory, following files are generated after an execution of `when` clause in a test script.

----
{testsuite-directory}/{testcase-#}.json-output/
  execution.txt
  exit_code.txt <1>
  precheck.txt
  script.txt    <2>
  stderr.txt    <3>
  stdout.txt    <4>
----

<1> A file to store exit code from `when` clause.
<2> A file to store the script generated by converting the content of `when` clause.
<3> A file to store the content which 2. wrote to stderr.
<4> A file to store the content which 2. wrote to stdout.

From those, `testreport.json` file, and then from it, `testreport.adoc` file is generated.

==== Test Report

After all tests are executed, `testreport.json` is generated and then `testreport.adoc` is generated from it.

.testreport.adoc example
====
image:src/site/docs/resources/images/testreport-example.png[]]
====

To browse the rendered report, following tools will be useful.

- AsciidocFX<<asciidocfx>>
- Intellij IDEA<<intellij>> +  Asciidoc plugin<<asciidoc-intellij-plugin>>

In case you need to render it into an html file, you can use a command line tool called `asciidoctor` <<asciidoc2html>>.

=== Work Directory

Under work directory, `commandunit` generates internal files that usually you are not interested in.
You can specify the path of the directory by `--test-workdir`, and its default is `target/commandunit/work`.

== Design of `commandunit`

The `commandunit` uses `jq-front`<<jq-front>> to let users write tests.
`jq-front` is a tool that allows you to use inheritances and node references (and more) in JSON files.

When it finds a file ends with `.yaml{plus}{plus}`, the tool converts it to a JSON file first and the converted file will have a suffix `.json{plus}{plus}`.
Then the `.json{plus}{plus}` files will be converted into '.json' file using `jq-front`.
(preprocess stage) So, familiarizing yourself with `jq-front` 's syntax will be very useful.

After this preprocessing step is finished, based on the content of the final JSON files, which should contain full-information to execute a test case, `commandunit` executes the test case.
(run stage)

Then, from the files generated during the "run stage", `commandunit` generates a test report.

Check link:https://dakusui.github.io/commandunit/designConcept.html[Design Concept] and link:https://dakusui.github.io/commandunit/designDetail.html[Design Detail] pages of `commandunit` for more detail.
